# data-analytics-twitter
A data analytics tool in R for twitter.

Using the Twitter API, the tweets along with its metadata can be extracted and converted into a dataframe. Textmining is done by building a corpus and this is used to build a Term Document Matrix (TDM).

We can use this data to perform multiple analysis on tweets:

* Generating frequent words and forming a word cloud
* Word associations
* Topic modelling with LDA (LDA is a fully Bayesian version of probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (pLSI) which
  is a probabilistic version of LSA)
* Sentiment Analysis
* Forming a map according to the latitude and longitude
